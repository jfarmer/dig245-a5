    <h3><b><u>Observations I made about her actions</u></b></h3>
    <li>Keep in mind my sister is 12 and hasn't used Reddit before!</li>
    <li>She figured out how to create an account almost immediately, helped by the giant SIGN UP button at the top.</li>
    <li>It took her another minutes to find the "night mode" switch. She clicked around until she accidentally opened settings.</li>
    <li>To try and find a COVID-19 thread, she searched "coronavirus" into the search bar. She got this as the top result: </li>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/pKf0SL8"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNk1sx5/Top-Post.jpg" alt="Top Post"></a>
    <li>She clicked on the image first since it was the biggest thing there, but that just opened up the article.</li>
    <li>She went back to the search result but couldn't figure out how to open the actual thread!</li>
    <li>After 3 minutes, she went back to the home page by clicking the back arrow button.</li>
    <li>In the homepage, she decided to scroll through all the threads, looking for a COVID-19 related one.</li>
    <li>At the beginning of minute 4, she finds an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/fpzdpx/this_dog/">r/aww</a> post...</li>
    <li>She then figured out that clicking r/aww will lead her to the subreddit and spends the rest of minute 4 looking at cute animals.</li>
    <li>Now that she's discovered subreddits, she realizes she can go to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/">r/COVID19</a> subreddit.</li>
    <li>At 5 and a half minutes, she opens a thread titled "Weekly Question Thread" in the COVID-19 subreddit.</li>
    <li>While in that thread, she double clicks on the first comment hoping to like it. When that gives no response, she clicks the up arrow on the right.</li>
    <li>After 6 minutes, she gets back to the homepage with back arrows again but I tell her to do it with buttons instead.</li>
    <li>She completes all the tasks after about 6 and a half minutes when she clicks the "Reddit" button on the top left.</li>
    <li>I confirm that she has completed the tasks and she spends the rest of the 10 minutes looking at r/aww posts :)</li>
