  <h1><center>Usability Test</center></h1>
  <p><center>Hello. My name is Kendahl and I just conducted super secret and important
    research on my mother, Debra.
  </p></center>

  <center><div class="gallery">
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.academy.com/">
      <img src="https://d15z7dtgvh220z.cloudfront.net/images/ex-desc/academysportsoutdoorshomepageimage.png" alt="Academy" width="400" height="300">
    </a>
    <div class="desc"> The right stuff and low price everyday... Academy!
    </div></center>

    <ol><u><strong>I gave my mom a list of tasks to complete while on Academy's website.</u></strong>
      <li>The first task was to find a 'Contact Us' button/link.</li>
      <li>The second task was to find where you could 'Create An Account.'</li>
      <li>The third task was to find the companies 'About Us' or 'Our Mission' Section</li>
      <li>The fourth task was to use to search bar and see how effective it was.</li>
      <li>The fifth and final task was to find where you could follow them on social media.</li>
      </ol>

<center><h1>The Results</h1></center>

<center><p>1. For the first test, the subject went straight to the bottom of the page
because she saw no 'Contact Us' at the top.
There were options to 'Chat Now,' and 'Customer Care' at the bottom of the page.
<strong>Test 1 was a success!</strong></p></center>

<center><p>2. For the second test, the test subject scrolled to the top of the page
expecting to find 'Create An Account.' She saw 'My Account' and decided to click it.
Once she clicked it she saw and clicked 'Sign Up.'
<strong>Test 2 was a success!</strong></p></center>

<center><p>3. For the third test, the subject scrolled to the bottom of the page and said that
she checks the bottom whenever she doesn't see what she's looking for at the top.
She didn't see an 'About Us,' but instead found an 'Our History' page and decided to click that.
She learned about the companies history and a bit about what they stood for, so I'll deem
<strong>Test 3 a half Success.</strong> Not because of the user, but because of the website itself.</p></center>

<center><p>4. For the fourth test, the subject searched 'Baseball Gloves' in the search bar.
The results were extremely helpful and gave her three things to click: 'Adult, Youth, or T-Ball.'
The subject looked over several gloves before she found the one she liked.
<strong>Test 4 was a success!</strong></p></center>

<center><p>5. For the fifth and final test, our subject was particularly confident.
She claimed that this step will be easy and scrolled to the bottom of the page to find the links to follow
Academy on social media. When she got to the bottom of the page, she didn't see anything that said "Follow Us," so
she decided to click 'Community Relations.' Once there, she realized
she couldn't find what she was looking for. She found something labeled 'Connect,' but that wasn't it. After giving the
subject a little hint (oops), She realized the little circles in the bottom left corner
took you to their social media pages.
<strong>Test 5 was a half success.</strong> Again, not the user's fault...</p></center>

<center><h1>Advice to the Website's Owner</h1></center>

<center><p>Considering the high success rate, there isn't a whole lot I'd change about the website's layout.
The only advice I'd give would be to consider the different age groups using their website.
Someone who is in the 40+ range (like our test subject) may not recognize
the social media icons in the bottom corner of the website (proven by our test subject).
I would also tell the owner to consider changing the label of 'Our History' to 'About Us,' and have more
info about themselves on that page as well. All in All, the website is effective and not
overly complicated to use. <strong>I'd give it a 7/10.</strong></p></center>
