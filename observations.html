    <h3><b><u>What I found out about Reddit</u></b></h3>
    <li>I figured out that Reddit isn't exactly user friendly at the start. There isn't a tutorial or specific arrows to direct users.</li>
    <li>It isn't immediately clear that a thread is or where to find it. She ran into a lot of issues opening external links instead of threads.</li>
    <li>It's rather difficult to distinguish between a subreddit and a thread since both look like a bunch of comments on a page.</li>
    <li>Users likely have a lot of assumptions coming from other platforms, for example, my sister's double click came from the idea of double-taping to like a picture on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></li>
    <li>While she managed to figure out Reddit in under 10 minutes, it still took a lot of confirmation from me to see if her actions were correct.</li>
    <li>Falling into the Reddit rabbit hole is way too easy. She fell into it within her first time using it!</li>
