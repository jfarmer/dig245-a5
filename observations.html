          <h1>Task 1: </h1>
          <h3>Find how many mutual followers you share with a specified user (in this case, me!)</h3>
          <p>During this first task, the user talked out their thought process as they went about it.
            First, the user found my profile and from there noticed the line in the bio that says "Followed by:" and proceeded to list followers that
            we had in common. The website gives you the option to click on the number part of that line (in this case, "71 more") and a window pops up
            that allows you to scroll through a complete list of mutual followers.

            To find the actual number however, the only metric that is given is the "71". The user had to add the three names
            proceeding it to get the actual total (74).

          <h1>Task 2: </h1>
          <h3>Find the most popular commenet under Beyonce's most recent post</h3>
          <p>After searching for the profile of the legendary Queen Bey, the user proceeded to look through the comments
            for the one with the most likes. I will admit, I hadn't realized the Beyonce had blessed our feeds within the last
            thirty minutes with a new post, so comments were still rolling in. After about two minutes of browsing, the user settled on
            the first comment they say as having the most the likes, and therefore the most popular.

          <h1>Task 3: </h1>
          <h3>See the user's posts in order from greatest number of likes to least number of likes</h3>
          <p>This one was pretty simple. The user navigated to their profile page and scrolled to their posts. Posts are by
            default sorted by most recent at the top and oldest at the bottom. The only the user could see the number of likes without
            clicking on the post was by hover over it. Hovering over a post displays the number of likes and the number of comments,
            as shown in the screenshot below. There was no way to actually organize the posts, however. They can only be sorted by date.
          </p>

          <h1>Task 4: </h1>
          <h3>See the user's posts in order from greatest number of comments to least number of comments</h3>
          <p>Same story as with Task 3. Some other observations made here, however, were that the post with the most number of comments was NOT the
            the same as the post with the most number of likes, which surprised the user. It was also realized that you can also only view another profile
            by most recent.
          </p>

        <div class="col">
          <h1>Task 5: </h1>
          <h3>Find a list of suggested followers</h3>
          <p>This wasn't the hardest task for the user, but it was the most interesting. When told the task, the user indicated that they believed going to
            their "Discover" page would be the best option. When we arrived on that page we saw this:
          </p>
          <h3>Screenshot 1:</h3>
          <img src="images/discoverPage.png">
          <p>
            This was sufficient. The user, however, believed that there was another way to see this as well and relied on their experience using the Instagram app on
            on their phone. With this came the realization that clicking on the notifications/likes icon can also lead a user to their
            suggested followers. The user in this test has a private account so by clicking on their follower requests, they were able to see their list of
            suggested followers, as in the screenshot below. I would be interested in seeing how this would differ on a public account.
